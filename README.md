# 📈 Stock Market Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This project analyzes and forecasts stock market trends using time series models such as **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM**. It also includes a **Streamlit dashboard** to generate interactive stock forecasts.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Collect and preprocess historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance.
- Apply ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models to forecast stock prices.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE.
- Visualize forecasts with Matplotlib and Streamlit dashboard.
- Optional: Deploy dashboard locally using Streamlit.
